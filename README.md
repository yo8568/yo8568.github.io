## Usage

For detailed instructions on how to configure, customize, add content, and more read the [theme's documentation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/).

**Note:** Gem version of the theme requires Jekyll v3.3+ and is not currently supported on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can still use the theme with GitHub Pages, you'll just need to install using the old "[repo fork method](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/installation/)".

## Quick Start

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "minimal-mistakes-jekyll"
```

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml` file:

```yaml
theme: minimal-mistakes-jekyll
```

Then run Bundler to install the theme gem and dependencies:

```bash
bundle install
```

To update the theme run `bundle update`.
